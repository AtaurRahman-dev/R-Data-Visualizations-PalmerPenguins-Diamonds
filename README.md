# R Data Visualizations: PalmerPenguins & Diamonds

This repository contains exploratory data visualizations created using R and the `ggplot2` package.  
The project uses two popular datasets: [palmerpenguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) and [diamonds](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/diamonds.html).

## Overview

The goal of this project is to practice data visualization techniques and better understand patterns within the data through charts and plots. The visuals demonstrate:

- Scatter plots with color, shape, and transparency aesthetics  
- Adding smooth trend lines  
- Bar charts with counts and mean summaries  
- Faceting to compare subgroups  
- Plot annotations for storytelling  

## Datasets

- **Palmer Penguins:** Data about penguin species, flipper length, body mass, and other biological measurements  
- **Diamonds:** Data on diamond characteristics like cut, color, clarity, and price  

## Usage

To reproduce these plots, install the necessary packages and run the R scripts:

```r
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("palmerpenguins")
library(ggplot2)
library(palmerpenguins)
# Then run the visualization code from this repo
